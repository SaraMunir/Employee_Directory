# Employee_Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I  had to create a employee directory with React. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by employees first name, last name and date of Birth Category;

  * Filter the employees by at their name;
